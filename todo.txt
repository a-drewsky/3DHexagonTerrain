Issues:
   Dice spinning faster and not in correct position on smaller map sizes
   Attacker group color not changing back sometimes
   Nothing happened when game finished

Look over everything. Comment all functionality. Remove any console logs.
   Remove Button Manager from StateManager
   Organize top level variables



Additional refactoring
   Split dice map into HexGroupDiceMap, DiceBattle and Scoreboard.
   HexGroupDiceMap extends HexGroupMap extends HexMap.
   All game objects should have one draw function called draw().
   Get rid of HexGroup and GameState classes. Implement as objects.
   Create UI utilities class and create Views instead of UIManager
   GameObjects and Views should not have more than one canvas
   Views are just a draw function with attributes
   All GameObjectBuilders should take in properties and only have a public build() function. All other functions should be inner functions and not publics
      In addition check all objects for functions that should be private.



Create aiController classes
   Add number of human players to game options
   Instead of showing player # won at the end show You won or You lost
   Add "human" to human players on scoreboard
      This will be usernames in the youtube player

ai alogrithm
   make list of all posible moves (attacker and defender)
   each move has 2 stats: probability and priority
      probability is decided by the ratio of attacking dice to defending dice
         equal amount of dice has 0.25 probability, double amount of dice has 0.75 probability
      priority is highest when there is an equal amount of same and different groups neighboring the defender and lowest when there is only one or the other
   sort moves by priority
   test each move in order against its probability
      when a move passes execute that move
      stop all dice and await outcome
      repeat the entire process
   if all moves are tested without any passing then end turn
