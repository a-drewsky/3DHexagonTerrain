   make list of all posible moves (attacker and defender)
   each move has 2 stats: probability and priority
      probability is decided by the ratio of attacking dice to defending dice
         equal amount of dice has 0.25 probability, double amount of dice has 0.75 probability
      priority is highest when there is an equal amount of same and different groups neighboring the defender and lowest when there is only one or the other
   sort moves by priority
   test each move in order against its probability
      when a move passes execute that move
      stop all dice and await outcome
      repeat the entire process
   if all moves are tested without any passing then end turn
