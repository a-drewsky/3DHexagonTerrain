-dice size and position bug on different map sizes

-test screen sizes

-refactor and make reusable componenets

-move youtube player to aws

-figure out ai and networking

-start infastructure project



Hexagon class is not neccessary
   Move into hexMap class and remove hexagon class

HexMap should be capitalized in HexMap and HexMapBuilder

Do after refactoring

Remove hexGrid class and create reusable componenets: hexMap, hexMapBuilder, buttonManager
Group classes can be included with hexMap package

issue with image size on different map sizes

create buttonManager inside of uiManager: when button is clicked create interval the displays it in a darker color and slightly smaller

BUG: after player has no more group, click stops working, still goes to player turn



When game ends hide canvas and show 'You won this game' or 'You lost this game' instead. 
   use gameComplete variable

Create playerController and aiController classes
   Add number of human players to game options
   Add "human" to human players on scoreboard
      This will be usernames in the youtube player


ai alogrithm
   make list of all posible moves (attacker and defender)
   each move has 2 stats: probability and priority
      probability is decided by the ratio of attacking dice to defending dice
         equal amount of dice has 0.25 probability, double amount of dice has 0.75 probability
      priority is highest when there is an equal amount of same and different groups neighboring the defender and lowest when there is only one or the other
   sort moves by priority
   test each move in order against its probability
      when a move passes execute that move
      stop all dice and await outcome
      repeat the entire process
   if all moves are tested without any passing then end turn
