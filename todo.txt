BUGS
    -Rotating while moving resets camera to the last position before moving
    -Tile height & stroke size should be relative to zoom level
    -Rendering is a bit slow
        -Try to optimize Rendering
        -Try pre-rendering
        -Try resizing image when zooming



-Make a trello board to track progess

    -atm the settings would be height levels for grass, rock and snow.
    -This could change when more complex generation is added.
    -Maybe have a color for each biome + height range

    -elevation
    -temperature
    -dryness/wetness
    -lakes and waterfalls
        -generate rivers and lakes
        -water tiles should not be on the edge (like a cliff) unless connecting to a water tile below

    -Mountain peaks
    -Castles
    -Trees / Forests / Swamps etc...
